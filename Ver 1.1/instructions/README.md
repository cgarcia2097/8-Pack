# Assembly instructions

#### Currently a WIP, but folder structure and naming should guide the builder in the assembly of this board. 

Please take care in following the order of assembly, switch steps at your own risk. 

This guide assumes the use of Novelkeys-style BOX switches, which necessitates LEDs being inserted before the keyswitch. If using a traditional-style Cherry switch, the keyswitch and LED can be inseted and soldered at the same time.

Happy building, minna.
